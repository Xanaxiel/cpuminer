This is a multi-threaded Cell BE optimized miner for Litecoin,
fork of Jeff Garzik's reference cpuminer.

Miner threads are first allocated to the available SPU cores (typically 6).
The remaining threads are allocated to PPU. There will be usually 8 threads
total on PS3: 6 SPU threads and 2 PPU threads.
